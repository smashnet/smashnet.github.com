<h3>What?</h3>

<p>If you ever have been in the situation of needing to synchronize data across your devices and friends, you know that most common tools are either slow or unsecure, maybe even both. Peergroup is an approach that empowers you to sync your devices using P2P technology. You can also sync with your friend's devices, allowing you to collaboratively work on a project with them or simply share data, there are no limits in the world of file based data!</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>Current version: 0.04<br>
Skim through the list of available downloads <a href="https://github.com/smashnet/Peergroup/downloads">here</a>!</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We have a strong focus on efficient data exchange. The P2P data exchange is inspired by the BitTorrent technology that has proven to deliver fast distribution of data across many devices. You can additionally ensure that all shared data is never located outside one of the devices that share with one another. There is no point where your data is stored besides on your devices.</p>

<p>Peergroup manages the devices and users using (password protected) XMPP Multi-User-Channels. So all you need to use Peergroup is an XMPP account, currently one per device. Registering an XMPP account is free an does not require any personal data. Just join to the same Multi-User-Channel with all your devices using the Peergroup client, and they will sync the data in the shared folder automatically.</p>
