					<h3>Flattr button and new logo</h3>
					<h5>Mon, Mar 11 2013, 19:01</h5>
					<p align="justify">
						Today I joined a great site called <a href="https://www.flattr.com">Flattr</a> which allows users and visitors to 
						do micropayments to the creators whose contents they use.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						So if Peergroup is worth being supported in your opinion, I would highly appreciate your flattr :-) However, Peergroup
						is free, and will stay free.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Another thing I will show you is the new logo. A few weeks ago I was doodling around on my iPad. I had nothing special in 
						mind until I came to the idea of creating a logo for Pgrp. So this is my inartistic result :-P<br>
						<img src="images/logo_small_transp.png" width="200"><br>
						<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/peergroup-p2p-syncing">Discuss in the usergroup!</a><br>
						Hope you will feel convenient with this in your taskbar :D
						<br><br>
						Cheers,<br>

					<h3>First parts of a GUI available in "development" branch</h3>
					<h5>Tue, Feb 12 2013, 12:11</h5>
					<p align="justify">
						Now that I have a bit more time for programming I yesterday started reimplementing some parts of my GUI draft in Swing.
						The first draft was only a local try, and never appeard in the sources. It used SWT as framework. I finally decided to 
						use Swing as it is available on all Java supported platforms. Further I liked it that Swing does not need any additional 
						libraries to be included in the final jar file. SWT would have cost approx. 6MB extra for each supported OS.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						The implemented GUI parts are a starting point for the GUI, and will soon be filled with live ;-) For developers 
						convenience I also included necessary Eclipse project files in the "development" branch of the repository. However, 
						I will continue supporting the build.xml file in the repo to maintain usability for non-Eclipse hackers.<br><br>
						Cheers,<br>
						Nico

					<h3>Fixed "changed-file-size" bug</h3>
					<h5>Mon, Feb 04 2013, 22:49</h5>
					<p align="justify">
					    I just managed to fix this severe bug that caused PG to infinitely download file chunks.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
					    The reason for this bug was that not all chunks of a shrinked file got removed from PGs internal datastructure.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
					    I highly recommend only using the current version 0.06dev from the sources which incorporates the bug fix already!<br><br>
					    Cheers,<br>Nico

					<h3>Made progress fixing bug</h3>
					<h5>Fri, Feb 01 2013, 12:42</h5>
					<p align="justify">
						I made substantial progress fixing the "changed-file-size-bug".
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Besides of a corner case where the original files size is a multiple of the chunksize and the changed size afterwards is also
						a multiple of the chunksize, and sizes change from A->B->A, everything should work fine.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						You find the fixes in the "development" version of Peergroup. Of course I will soon handle the mentioned corner case as well, 
						and will then continue heading at improved file-transfer encryption and GUI development.
					</p>

						Cheers,<br>Nico

					<h3>Bug: Weird behaviour if file changes its size</h3>
					<h5>Sun, Jan 27 2013, 13:37</h5>
					<p align="justify">
						This bug is not all new, but I didn't really check the programs behaviour in this case until yesterday.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						The problem:
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Let's say you have a file in your shared directory which is 50MB in size. The default chunk size Peergroup uses is 512kB.
						If the file changes and and afterwards its size differs more than 512kB from it's original size, Peergroup will go weird.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						So basically the weird behavior is caused if a file has more or less chunks after an update. In this case Peergroup downloads
						wrong chunks from the peer with the updated file, then compares the hashes of the wrong chunks with the hashes which would be 
						correct, and finally attempts to redownload these (wrong) chunks because of the failed hash check.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						I will work hard to fix this soon, but currently my exam preparations have a higher priority.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						To spread some hope and happiness, the next update will not just fix this bug, it will also introduce these features:
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Server mode (keep data available permanently if no other computers are online)</li>
							<li>Switch between "No Encryption", "AES-128", "AES-256"</li>
							<li>Improved detection of local IP (now also works on Linux computers)</li>
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Cheers,<br>Nico

					<h3>Released Version 0.05</h3>
					<h5>Mon, Dec 17 2012, 14:42</h5>
					<p align="justify">
						Together with the new website I release the new <a href="files/pg_v005.zip">version 0.05</a> of PG. 
						There are quite some features you might have been waiting for:
					</p>
					Change Log:
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Encrypted data transfers (using AES-128) (AES-256 will come in 0.06)</li>
							<li>Settins are now stored in config.xml (no need for long start script anymore)</li>
							<li>XMPP password is no longer shown in process list</li>
							<li>Warns you to manually forward the P2P port in the firewall if no UPnP capable router was found</li>
							<li>Fixed a bug that prevented you from joining	a password protected channel</li>
							<li>Fixed a bug that caused directories to be not deleted properly</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p align="justify">
						Have fun with this new release! Looking forward to your comments in the 
						<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/peergroup-p2p-syncing">
							discussion forum</a>!<br><br>
							Cheers,<br>Nico

					<h3>Welcome to pgrp.de</h3>
					<h5>Mon, Dec 17 2012, 13:50</h5>
					
					<p align="justify">
						I'm glad you found your way to the brand new website of the P2P syncing tool Peergroup.
						I previously used to publish news about Peergroup in it's 
						<a href="https://github.com/smashnet/Peergroup/wiki">GitHub Wiki</a> and on my other 
						blog <a href="http://www.smashnet.de">smashnet.de</a>. Unfortunately there was no single 
						place where you could get all information and discuss about the project, so this little 
						website arose.
					</p>
					
					<p align="justify">
						All new versions of Peergroup will be commented here with a blog post, telling you 
						which new features were implemented and anything else what seems important to me :)
					</p>
					
					<p align="justify">
						Have a look at the top-right of the site! I am very happy about every participation in 
						the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/peergroup-p2p-syncing">discussion 
						group</a>. Every idea, hint or whatever is welcome!
					</p>
					
					<p align="justify">
						Cheers,<br>Nico
